## Synthesizing Informative Training Samples with GAN [[PDF]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.07513.pdf)

The experiment data have been released in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qyxK4XxboBRuQVwesxQTSx-Vpcp1fCeS?usp=sharing).
The released data include: [1] pretrained BigGAN Generators; [2] GAN Inversion learned latent vectors (z); [3] IT-GAN learned latent vectors (z). 

We also provide some raw training codes which have been neither re-organized nor validated. Just for reference. The raw training code is [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vENTbqDdt6f0K2fQpuUfuCEnj_09Bqeh?usp=sharing). Replace md_utils.py with utils.py, md_networks.py with networks.py if applicable.
