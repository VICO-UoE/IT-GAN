## Synthesizing Informative Training Samples with GAN [[PDF]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.07513.pdf)

### Coming soon!

The experiment data have been released in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qyxK4XxboBRuQVwesxQTSx-Vpcp1fCeS?usp=sharing).
The release data include: [1] pretrained BigGAN Generators; [2] GAN Inversion learned latent vectors (z); [3] IT-GAN learned latent vectors (z). 

Currently, we provide some raw codes which have been neither re-organized nor validated. Just for reference. We will release well-polished training and testing codes in the future.
